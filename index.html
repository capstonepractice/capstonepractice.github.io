        <h1>Stephen Clark</h1>
        <h5>Web Developer: <em>In Training</em></h5>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Stephen Clark and I am in the process of learning
            front-end web development through a program named <a href="https://vetswhocode.io/" target="_blank">Vets Who Code</a>.
            <em>Vets Who Code</em> is a veteran-led program that trains veterans in web development and is 100% 
            free of charge. I created this website to showcase some of the skills I haved learned so far as I await 
            training to start.</p>
        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p class="aboutme">I am retired from the United States Marine Corps 
            and live near Camp Lejeune, NC. I am a native of California but decided to make NC my 
            permanent home after retiring. I am currently using my G.I. Bill to complete a Bachelor of Science 
            in Information Technology with a focus on Cybersecurity at Excelsior College. 
            Since I have retired I have taken on some new challenges. I am hoping that my education and the 
            Vets Who Code program lead me to a new career in the IT field and will make me better rounded in the STEM field. 
            My hobbies include cycling, gardening, playing Xbox, watching movies, and traveling. 
            I have created a small business where I make gourmet pickles named <a href="http://www.angrypickles.com" target="_blank">Angry Pickles</a>. 
            I have been told time and time again that I make pickles to die for. 
            In my off-time, I can usually be found either messing around in 
            my garage, making pickles, or cycling through the countryside. I am married with no kids 
            and have two dogs, four geese, five ducks, and eighteen hens.</p>
